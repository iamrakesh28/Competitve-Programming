I'm a undergraduate 2nd year student from India. As I stated above, my family annual income is around 90,000 INR. My college fee per semester is around 30,000 INR. My family lives in rural area. My father is a farmer. They somehow manages to pay my college fee but paying 3k per month for a course is beyond my family budget. I did my Machine Learning course(didn't purchase the certificate) and found it interesting so, I decided to do deep learning course. I thought that I could audit the course but the main problem is that even after auditing, the assignments were locked. I just wanted to complete the assignments.



This course will help me learn Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep leaning, structuring Machine Leaning projects and how to improve Neural Networks. I want to apply these algorithms to build various AI projects such as face recognition, training some games, training robots,etc.
This will also help me to get specialised in deep learning and get a job. I also want to contribute in the development of Artificial Intelligence. In future, I want to do some research on Artificial Intelligence.
